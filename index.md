# Biography

<img src="https://chyj528.github.io/yijunchen.jpg" class="floatpic" width="360" height="480">

Here is **Yijun Chen (Daisy, 陈依珺)**.

I am currently a Ph.D. Candidate in Control System Engineering
at [Australian Center for Robotics](https://www.sydney.edu.au/engineering/our-research/robotics-and-intelligent-systems/australian-centre-for-field-robotics.html)
, University of Sydney, supervised by Associate
Professor [Guodong Shi](https://www.sydney.edu.au/engineering/about/our-people/academic-staff/guodong-shi.html)
and
Professor [Ian Manchester](https://www.sydney.edu.au/engineering/about/our-people/academic-staff/ian-manchester.html)
. Before that, I received my bachelor’s degree in Digital Media Technology from
Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China, in 2019,
advised by Lecturer Rongfeng Li.

## Research Interests

My research interests are mainly about learning, decision making, optimization
and control in multi-agent systems, which is closely related to game theory,
control theory, network science and optimization.

The specific problems I have worked on so far are as follows:

- price shaping problem (to guarantee unit resource price under a threshold);
- network structure inference (to learn the underlying network structure given
  public behavioral data);
- differentially private games (to protect the privacy of payoff functions in
  information aggregation processes);
- cooperation and non-cooperation under Dynamic/Regional Integrated Climate
  Economy framework (to provide insights for regional climate policies from the
  perspective of game theory and optimal control).

In the future, I wish to contribute more to the areas of networked control 
systems and cooperative/non-cooperative control and optimization, with 
applications to cyber-physical systems, manufacturing systems, smart cities 
and so on.
