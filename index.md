## Biography

Here is **Yijun Chen (Daisy, 陈依珺)**. I am currently a Ph.D. Candidate in Control
System Engineering
at [Australian Center for Robotics](https://www.sydney.edu.au/engineering/our-research/robotics-and-intelligent-systems/australian-centre-for-field-robotics.html)
, University of Sydney, supervised by Associate
Professor [Guodong Shi](https://www.sydney.edu.au/engineering/about/our-people/academic-staff/guodong-shi.html)
and
Professor [Ian Manchester](https://www.sydney.edu.au/engineering/about/our-people/academic-staff/ian-manchester.html)
. Before that, I received my bachelor’s degree in Digital Media Technology from
Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China, in 2019,
advised by Lecturer Rongfeng Li.



## Research Interests


My research interests are mainly about learning, decision making, optimization
and control in multi-agent systems, which is closely related to game theory,
control theory, network science and optimization. 


In the future, I wish to contribute more to the areas of networked control
systems and cooperative/non-cooperative control and optimization, with
applications to cyber-physical systems, manufacturing systems, smart cities and
so on.
