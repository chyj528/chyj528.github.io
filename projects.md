# Research Projects

The specific problems I have worked on so far are as follows:

- network structure inference;
  
- differentially private games;

- price shaping problem;
  
- cooperation and non-cooperation for climate-economics.
  
### Network structure inference;
(to learn the underlying network structure 
  given public behavioral data),

### Differentially private games;
(to protect the privacy of payoff functions 
  in information aggregation processes),

### Price shaping problem;
 (to guarantee unit resource price under a threshold)
 
### Cooperation and non-cooperation for climate-economics.

(to provide insights for regional climate policies from the perspective of game theory and optimal control).
