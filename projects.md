## Research Projects

The specific problems I have worked on so far are as follows:

- [network structure inference](https://chyj528.github.io/mypaper/ACC_2023_Learn_Game_Structure.pdf);
- [differentially private games](https://chyj528.github.io/mypaper/ACC_2023_Private_Game.pdf);
- [price shaping problem](https://chyj528.github.io/mypaper/Automatica_2022.pdf);
- [cooperation and non-cooperation for climate-economics](https://chyj528.github.io/mypaper/arXiv_climate.pdf).

### Network Structure Inference

We investigate the capacity of an adversary to learn the underlying interaction
network through repeated best response actions in linear-quadratic games. The
adversary strategically perturbs the decisions of a set of action-compromised
players and observes the sequential decisions of a set of action-leaked players.
The central question pertains to whether such an adversary can fully reconstruct
or effectively estimate the underlying interaction structure among the players.

To begin with, we establish a series of results that characterize the
learnability of the interaction graph from the adversary's perspective by
drawing connections between this network learning problem in games and classical
system identification theory. Subsequently, taking into account the inherent
stability and sparsity constraints inherent in the network interaction
structure, we propose a stable and sparse system identification framework for
learning the interaction graph under both full player action observation and
partial player action observation.

Some of the results is accepted by ACC2023. The complete manuscript is 
available on request.
