## Research Projects

The specific problems I have worked on so far are as follows:

- [network structure inference](https://chyj528.github.io/mypaper/ACC_2023_Learn_Game_Structure.pdf);
- [differentially private games](https://chyj528.github.io/mypaper/ACC_2023_Private_Game.pdf);
- [price shaping problem](https://chyj528.github.io/mypaper/Automatica_2022.pdf);
- [cooperation and non-cooperation for climate-economics](https://chyj528.github.io/mypaper/arXiv_climate.pdf).
