## Research Projects

The specific problems I have worked on so far are as follows:

- network structure inference;
  
- differentially private games;

- price shaping problem;
  
- cooperation and non-cooperation for climate-economics.
  
### Network Structure Inference
(to learn the underlying network structure 
  given public behavioral data),

### Differentially Private Games
(to protect the privacy of payoff functions 
  in information aggregation processes),

### Price Shaping Problem
 (to guarantee unit resource price under a threshold)

### Cooperation and Non-cooperation for Climate-Economics
(to provide insights for regional climate policies from the perspective of game theory and optimal control).
